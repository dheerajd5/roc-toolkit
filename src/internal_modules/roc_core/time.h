    //! @remarks
    //!  Starts at unspecified point of time.
    //!
    //!  When platform supports it, uses the clock source that grows monotonically. It
    //!  never jumps backwards and is not affected by system clock change.
    //!
    //!  This clock is still subject to clock rate adjustments applied by NTP daemon.
    //!  When it performs synchronization, it may slightly speed up or slow down both
    //!  unix and monotonic clocks for a while.
    //!
    //!  Usually this clock is reset after reboot.
    //!  Usually this clock does not count time spent in suspended state.
    //!
    //! @note
    //!  If platform does not have monotonic clock source, unix clock is used.
    //!  Actual precision is platform-dependent.

    //! @remarks
    //!  Starts at 1 Jan 1970 00:00:00.
    //!
    //!  May instantly jump forwards or backwards when system administrator sets time.
    //!  May speed up or slow down when NTP daemon adjusts clock rate.
    //!  May experience discontinuities when NTP daemon inserts leap seconds.
    //!
    //! @note
    //!  Available on all platforms.
